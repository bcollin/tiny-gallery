While clearing out my main drive, I ran into some old projects from the early 2000s.

This is a gallery I built for a customer who wanted something very basic. These days of course I would have plucked somethign from the internet.

It amuses how little PHP it took.

I have removed the customer's photos, modernised the HTML (i.e. changed the DTD) and have added an extra layer: the original did not have a list of galleries.
